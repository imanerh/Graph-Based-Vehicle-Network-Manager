# Graph-based Vehicle Network Manager

## Project Overview
This project develops a program to manage vehicles equipped with antennas, focusing on communication systems similar to automotive cars. It employs Graphs, particularly the Adjacency List method, for efficient data management and operations.

## Features
- **Graph Creation**: Reads from a text file to construct a graph with vehicle details, including transmission range and coordinates.
- **Graph Operations**: Includes displaying edges, listing adjacent vehicles, and updating the graph when vehicles move.
- **Graph Traversal**: Implements Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's Algorithm.
- **Shortest Path**: Finds the shortest path between two points.

## Program Execution Guide

To run the program, follow the steps below:

1. Download the program's zip folder.
2. Extract the contents of the zip folder to a convenient location on your computer.
3. Open the command-line terminal.

### Execution Steps

Follow the steps below to execute the program:

1. Navigate to the extracted folder in the command-line terminal using the `cd` command. For example:
    ```
    cd path/to/extracted/folder
    ```

2. Change the directory to the 'src' folder by executing the following command:
    ```
    cd src
    ```

3. Compile the Java files by running the following command:
    ```
    javac classes/*.java
    ```

4. Run the program using the following command:
    ```
    java classes/Main
    ```

5. The program will start executing, and any output or results will be displayed in the terminal.

**Note:** The `data.txt` file is included in the downloaded folder. You can make changes to this file as needed.
